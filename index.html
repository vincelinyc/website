            I'm currently Head of Product Design at <a class="td-none bbw-1x bbc-white bbs-dotted">Managed by Q</a> in New York. Before that I built data management tools at <a class="td-none bbw-1x bbc-white bbs-dotted">Moat</a> (acquired by Oracle) and worked on several products in Amsterdam.

            I started out as a <a class="td-none bbw-1x bbc-white bbs-dotted">graffiti artist</a> in rural Netherlands where I grew into graphic design. Shortly after I founded Dunkel and Hell (rip) to create artwork for Amsterdam's nightlife where we quickly discovered we wanted to be <span class="fs-italic">in</span> Nightlife and not just create for it. Scmeck Pony was born and so the numerous warehouse parties featuring the likes of Kabale und Liebe to Marcus Meinhardt to Marau Picotto.

            Through love for technology and a curiosity for the human mind, I moved into digital product design. At Q I exercise all these skills everyday because we operate at the intersection of people, space, and technology. Yes, the complexity is sometimes overwhelming but I could never turn back to a simple product and be bored. Solving hard problems is where it's at.
